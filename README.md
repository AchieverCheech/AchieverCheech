- 👋 Hi, I’m @AchieverCheech
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain development and cryptocurrencies. I also collect unique, often older books, reselling them from time to time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything about EVM, Solidity, smart contracts, programming/development and building dApps!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building out a secure, compliant crypto-marketplace, accepting alt-coins for a very specific type of merchandise (books!)
- 📫 How to reach me - bookbaz@pm.me /or/ achievercheech@protonmail.com
